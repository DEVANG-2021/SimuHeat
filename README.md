# SimuHeat
SimuHeat is a C++ simulation engine developed to model 2D heat diffusion using finite difference methods. The goal is to visualize the heat propagation across a flat surface and analyze thermal distribution patterns over time.

## 📌 Features

- Simulates 2D heat diffusion using numerical computation.
- Configurable grid size, thermal conductivity, and time steps.
- Outputs intermediate temperature fields at user-defined intervals.
- Visualizes simulation output in real-time using Gnuplot.
- Supports benchmarking and regression test scripts for reproducibility.
